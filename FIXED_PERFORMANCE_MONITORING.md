# 🎯 PERFORMANCE MONITORING - ISSUE FIXED

## 📋 Original Issue

```
7. 📊 NO ANALYTICS OR PERFORMANCE MONITORING
Severity: MEDIUM 🟡
* While Vercel Analytics is installed, there's no evidence of:
    * Performance budgets
    * Lighthouse scores
    * Core Web Vitals tracking
    * A11y audits
* Impact: Can't prove your portfolio is performant
* Fix: Add performance metrics, run Lighthouse audits, show scores
```

- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) - Visual stability
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint) - Initial render
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte) - Server response

### Lighthouse Scores (Lab Data)
- **Performance** - Overall speed
- **Accessibility** - A11y compliance
- **Best Practices** - Code quality
- **SEO** - Search optimization

### Resource Metrics
- JavaScript bundle size
- CSS bundle size
- Image sizes
- Font sizes
- Total page weight
- Resource count

## 🚀 How to Use

### See Performance in Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then check:
1. Browser console for performance badge
2. Bottom-right corner for live dashboard
3. Console logs for detailed metrics

### Run Full Performance Audit
```bash
npm run perf:audit
```
Opens HTML report in browser with:
- Performance score
- Opportunities for improvement
- Diagnostics
- Screenshots/filmstrip

### Run CI Audit (3 Runs)
```bash
npm run lighthouse:ci
```
More accurate median results from 3 runs.

### Check Performance Budget
```bash
npm run perf:budget
```
Validates your app against defined budgets.
