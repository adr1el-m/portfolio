- SEO: 90+

### 5. **Real-time Monitoring** ⚡
- Console performance badge with letter grade (A-F)
- Detailed performance reports in development mode
- Budget violation warnings
- Resource timing analysis
- Navigation timing breakdown

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Running Performance Audits

```bash
# 1. Run Lighthouse audit (requires build + preview)
npm run perf:audit

# 2. Run Lighthouse CI (3 runs, median results)
npm run lighthouse:ci

# 3. Check performance budget
npm run perf:budget

# 4. Manual Lighthouse (requires preview server running)
npm run preview  # In one terminal
npm run lighthouse  # In another terminal
```

### Development Mode
When running `npm run dev`, the performance monitor automatically:
- Tracks all Core Web Vitals
- Displays performance badge in console
- Shows detailed performance report
- Warns about budget violations
- Logs resource statistics

### Production Monitoring
In production (deployed on Vercel):
- Real user metrics collected via Vercel Speed Insights
- Core Web Vitals tracked and sent to Vercel dashboard
- View metrics at: https://vercel.com/[your-project]/analytics

## 🎯 Performance Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor | Current Budget |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| LCP | < 2.5s | 2.5s - 4s | > 4s | 2.5s |
| INP | < 200ms | 200ms - 500ms | > 500ms | 200ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 | 0.1 - 0.25 | > 0.25 | 0.1 |
| FCP | < 1.8s | 1.8s - 3s | > 3s | 1.8s |

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `lighthouserc.json`
Lighthouse CI configuration with performance thresholds.

### `performance-budget.json`
Performance budgets for timing, resource sizes, and resource counts.

### `src/modules/performance-monitor.ts`
Core Web Vitals tracking and reporting module.

## 📈 Optimization Tips

### If LCP is Slow:
- ✅ Optimize hero images (already implemented)
- ✅ Use lazy loading for below-fold images
- ✅ Inline critical CSS (already implemented)
- ✅ Preload key resources

### If INP is High:
- ✅ Minimize JavaScript execution time
- ✅ Use passive event listeners
- ✅ Debounce/throttle event handlers
- ✅ Optimize animations (use CSS transforms)

### If CLS is Poor:
- ✅ Add width/height to images (prevents layout shift)
- ✅ Reserve space for dynamic content
- ✅ Avoid inserting content above existing content
- ✅ Use CSS aspect-ratio

### If Bundle Size Exceeds Budget:
- Use code splitting
- Remove unused dependencies
- Enable tree shaking
- Compress assets

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Target scores for production:
- ✅ **Performance**: 95+
- ✅ **Accessibility**: 100
- ✅ **Best Practices**: 100
- ✅ **SEO**: 100

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Performance Monitor Not Working
```bash
# Check if web-vitals is installed
npm list web-vitals

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Lighthouse Audit Fails
```bash
# Make sure preview server is running
npm run preview

# Wait a few seconds, then run audit
npm run lighthouse
```

### No Data in Vercel Dashboard
- Ensure you're on a paid Vercel plan (Analytics requires Pro)
- Wait 24 hours after first deployment
- Check that analytics are enabled in Vercel project settings

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

### GitHub Actions (Optional)
Add to `.github/workflows/performance.yml`:

```yaml
name: Performance Audit
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run lighthouse:ci
```

This will run Lighthouse audits on every commit and PR.
